Through lilies and starless reflection
Eternal gaze in hollow perfection
Down the rabbit hole, caressing the shore
My slumber forevermore

Yonderday, no more, I spent life ablaze
Til no dawn was left onto set gaze
And at the shores of dusk parted ways
With my mortal vessel, for the rest of days

With a chill do we quake at the Maker's quill
Not so fond from a knife to have our life abscond
Yet come his will, we become His painted still
Left as I to ponder depths at death's pond.
